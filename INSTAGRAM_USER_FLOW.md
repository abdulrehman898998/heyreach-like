# Instagram Webhook Setup - Complete User Flow

## What I've Built

Perfect! Now I understand exactly what you need. Here's the complete flow I've implemented:

### 1. User Adds Instagram Account (For Automation)
- User goes to "Social Accounts" page
- Clicks "Add Account" 
- Enters their Instagram **username and password**
- This account is used for **bot automation** (sending messages)

### 2. User Connects Instagram Webhooks (For Reply Tracking)  
- On the same Instagram account card, they see "Webhook Connected: Not Connected"
- They click **"Connect"** button
- This opens Instagram OAuth popup
- They log in with **the same Instagram account** (OAuth flow)
- They grant permissions for webhooks
- Now replies to their messages will trigger webhooks!

### 3. Complete Flow:
```
1. Add Account: username/password â†’ Used for automation
2. Connect Webhook: OAuth popup â†’ Used for reply tracking
3. Start Campaign: Bot logs in with username/password â†’ Sends messages
4. Customer Replies: Instagram sends webhook â†’ Platform tracks reply
```
