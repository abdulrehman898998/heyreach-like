# Instagram DM Automation System

## Overview

This is an Instagram Direct Message automation system built with Electron and Playwright. The system allows users to send personalized DMs to Instagram profiles listed in a Google Sheets document. It features a desktop GUI for configuration and uses browser automation to interact with Instagram.

## System Architecture

The application follows a desktop application architecture with the following key layers:

1. **Desktop GUI Layer**: Electron-based frontend for user interaction
2. **Automation Engine**: Core automation logic using Playwright for browser control
3. **Data Integration Layer**: Google Sheets API integration for profile and message data
4. **Browser Automation Layer**: Playwright-controlled Chromium instances

## Key Components

### Frontend (Electron)
- **main.js**: Main Electron process that creates the application window and handles IPC communication
- **preload.js**: Security layer that exposes safe APIs to the renderer process
- **ui/index.html & ui/style.css**: User interface for configuration input and automation control

### Backend Automation
- **automation/index.js**: Main automation orchestrator that coordinates the entire process
- **automation/instagramBot.js**: Instagram-specific automation using Playwright browser control
- **automation/googleSheet.js**: Google Sheets API integration for fetching profile data

### Configuration Management
- Supports multiple Instagram accounts with rotation
- Google Sheets integration for dynamic profile and message management
- Configurable message limits per account

## Data Flow

1. **Configuration Input**: User enters Google Sheets credentials, Instagram accounts, and automation parameters through the Electron GUI
2. **Data Fetching**: System retrieves profile URLs and custom messages from specified Google Sheets range
3. **Account Rotation**: Instagram accounts are shuffled and used in rotation to distribute message load
4. **Browser Automation**: For each profile:
   - Launches Chromium with user data persistence
   - Logs into Instagram account
   - Navigates to target profile
   - Sends personalized DM
   - Implements delays and human-like behavior patterns
5. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time logging and progress updates sent back to the UI
