Webhooks for Instagram Messaging
Webhooks allows you to receive real-time HTTP notifications of changes to specific objects in the Meta social graph. For example, we could send you a notification when a customer sends your Instagram Professional account a message. Webhooks notifications allow you to track messaging changes and avoid rate limits that would occur if you were querying the Messenger Platform endpoints to track changes.

Requirements
You will need to implement the following requirements to receive Webhooks notifications for Instagram Messaging.

The instagram_basic, instagram_manage_messages, and pages_manage_metadata permissions
To get webhooks notification that include data owned or managed by people who do not have a role on your app, your app must have Advanced Access
Note: You will need to subscribe all messaging apps for your business to the messaging webhooks.

App Modes
Development Mode – Webhooks will only be sent if the person using your app has a role on the app, even if your app has Advanced Access. You can only access data you own or administer.
Live Mode – Webhooks will be sent depending on access level.
Standard Access – Webhooks will only be sent if the person using your app has a role on the app. You can only access data you own or administer.
Advanced Access – Webhooks will be sent when any person uses your app as long as the prerequisite permissions have been granted.

Limitations
When a customer reacts to or fowards an image from a carousel in an Instagram Post, the notification will include the first image in the carousel which may not be the image the customer reacted to or forwarded.
Only the URL for the shared media or post is included in the notification when a customer sends a message with a share.
Messages with gifs and stickers are not supported. If a person sends a message with a gif or sticker a webhook will not be triggered and a webhook notification will not be sent.
Disappearing media (view once, allow replay) is not supported on Instagram media webhooks.
