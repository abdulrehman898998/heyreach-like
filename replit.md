# SocialBot Pro - Social Media Automation Platform

## Overview

SocialBot Pro is a full-stack web application that automates Instagram and Facebook direct message campaigns. The system allows users to manage social media accounts, create automated campaigns using Google Sheets as data sources, and track performance through real-time analytics. Built with modern technologies including React, Express, PostgreSQL, and Playwright for browser automation.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript and Vite for fast development
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and React hooks for local state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for live campaign monitoring

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration with session-based authentication
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright for Instagram/Facebook interaction
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for live updates
- **API Design**: RESTful API with proper error handling and validation

### Database Schema
- **Users**: User profiles and authentication data
- **Social Accounts**: Instagram/Facebook account credentials
- **Google Sheets**: Sheet configurations and access tokens
- **Campaigns**: Automation campaign settings and status
- **Messages/Replies**: Communication tracking and analytics
- **Activity Logs**: Audit trail for all system actions

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Replit Auth integration for secure user management
- Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL session storage
- Automatic token refresh and unauthorized access handling

### Campaign Management
- Multi-platform support (Instagram and Facebook)
- Google Sheets integration for dynamic target lists
- Configurable message limits and timing delays
- Real-time campaign monitoring and control

### Browser Automation Engine
- Playwright-based Instagram and Facebook bots
- Sophisticated popup and modal handling
- Account rotation to distribute load
- Human-like interaction patterns with randomized delays

### Data Integration
- Google Sheets API integration for target data
- Real-time data fetching and validation
- Support for custom message templates and variables

### Analytics Dashboard

- Visual progress indicators and status updates

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users authenticate through Replit Auth and sessions are managed in PostgreSQL
2. **Account Setup**: Users add social media accounts and Google Sheets configurations
3. **Campaign Creation**: Users create campaigns by selecting platforms, accounts, and data sources
4. **Target Loading**: System fetches target profiles and messages from Google Sheets
5. **Automation Execution**: Browser automation sends messages with configurable delays
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket broadcasts progress updates to the frontend
7. **Analytics Collection**: All interactions are logged for performance analysis

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Project preferences: Skip reply tracking features as they are too complex. Focus on core automation features for Instagram/Facebook messaging.
Feature requests: Rotating proxy support for users to add proxy servers with username/password authentication.
Domain preference: Always use stable URL https://4e5d0c13-a2dd-49ed-8535-2554e092b236-00-t14c84l0xx4p.picard.replit.dev/ - never change domain configuration.
Technical preference: User has working local automation code that successfully handles Instagram login and messaging. Current web platform code has login issues and should be updated to match the working local patterns exactly.
