# 🚀 Complete Campaign Creation Guide

## ✅ **CAMPAIGN CREATION IS NOW WORKING!**

Your campaign creation flow is fully functional. Here's how it works:

## 📋 **Two-Step Campaign Creation Process**

### **Step 1: Basic Campaign Setup (Modal)**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5001/campaigns`
2. Click **"+ New Campaign"** button
3. Fill in:
   - **Campaign Name**: "My Test Campaign"
   - **Messages per Account**: 50
   - **Delay Between Messages**: 30 seconds
4. Click **"Create Campaign"**

### **Step 2: Full Campaign Configuration (Dedicated Page)**
After creating the basic campaign, you'll be automatically redirected to `/campaigns/create` where you can:

#### **🎯 Select Leads/Profiles**
- Upload CSV files with your target profiles
- Map columns (name, email, phone, etc.)
- Preview your lead data

#### **💬 Compose Messages**
- Write personalized messages
- Use variables like `{{name}}`, `{{email}}`, `{{company}}`
- Preview how messages will look with real data
- Type `/` to insert column variables

#### **📱 Select Instagram Accounts**
- Choose which Instagram accounts to use
- See account health scores
- Select all or specific accounts

#### **⚙️ Advanced Settings**
- Set message templates
- Configure delivery timing
- Set up account rotation

2. Login with `test@example.com` / `test123`
3. Go to Campaigns → "+ New Campaign"
4. Create campaign → Get redirected to full setup page
