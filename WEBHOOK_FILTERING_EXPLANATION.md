# Complete Webhook Filtering Solution

## Your Question: How to Filter Playwright vs Customer Messages?

**You're absolutely right!** Both Playwright automation AND customer replies trigger webhooks. Here's how the system handles this:

## 3-Layer Filtering System (Already Implemented)

### Layer 1: Echo Detection
```javascript
if (!message || (message as any).is_echo) {
  console.log('Skipping echo message or empty message');
  continue;
}
```
**What happens:**
- When Playwright sends: `is_echo: true` → FILTERED OUT
- When customer replies: `is_echo: false` → CONTINUES

### Layer 2: Direction Analysis  
```javascript
const senderId = messaging.sender.id;      // Who sent the message
const recipientId = messaging.recipient.id; // Who received the message

// Only process when YOUR business account is the RECIPIENT
const matchingAccount = businessAccounts.find(account => 
  account.instagramBusinessId === recipientId
);
```

**Real Examples:**

**❌ Playwright Automation Message:**
```json
{
  "sender": { "id": "your_business_123456" },    ← Your Instagram Business ID
  "recipient": { "id": "customer_789012" },     ← Customer's ID
  "message": { "text": "Hello!" },
  "is_echo": true
}
```
**Result:** FILTERED OUT (your business is sender + echo flag)

**✅ Customer Reply:**
```json
{
  "sender": { "id": "customer_789012" },        ← Customer's ID  
  "recipient": { "id": "your_business_123456" }, ← Your Instagram Business ID
  "message": { "text": "Hi back!" },
  "is_echo": false
}
```
**Result:** PROCESSED (your business is recipient = incoming reply)

### Layer 3: Business Account Validation
```javascript
if (!matchingAccount) {
  console.log('Message received for unknown business account:', recipientId);
  continue;
}
```

## Where Business IDs Come From:

### 1. **Your Business ID** (OAuth Connection)
```javascript
// When user connects webhook, we fetch their business ID:
const businessResponse = await fetch(
  `https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/${page.id}?fields=business&access_token=${pageAccessToken}`
);
const businessData = await businessResponse.json();
const businessId = businessData.business?.id; // Store this for filtering
```

### 2. **Customer ID** (Instagram Provides Automatically)
Every Instagram user has a unique ID that Instagram includes in webhook data automatically.

### 3. **Webhook Data** (Instagram Sends This)
Instagram automatically includes sender/recipient IDs in every webhook:
```javascript
// Instagram webhook payload structure
{
  "messaging": [{
    "sender": { "id": "auto_provided_by_instagram" },
    "recipient": { "id": "auto_provided_by_instagram" },
    "message": { "text": "message_content" }
  }]
}
```

## Current Implementation Status:

✅ **Echo filtering**: Implemented and working  
✅ **Direction filtering**: Implemented and working  
✅ **Business account validation**: Implemented and working  
🔄 **Business ID fetching**: Just added to OAuth flow  
📝 **Ready for testing**: System will correctly filter automation vs replies

## Test Flow:

1. **Add Instagram Account**: For Playwright automation
2. **Connect Webhook**: OAuth to get business ID  
3. **Send Message**: Playwright automation → webhook triggered with `is_echo: true` → FILTERED OUT
4. **Customer Replies**: Real reply → webhook triggered with your business as recipient → PROCESSED

The filtering system is complete and ready for testing!
